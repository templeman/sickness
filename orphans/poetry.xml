	<passage><body>keep digging until the maggots are out of the wounds </body></passage>
	<passage><body>there is grease atop the blood shimmering hypnotic and deadly </body></passage>
	<passage><body>dueling monologues that are starting to sound like schizophrenia </body></passage>
	<passage><body>exhausted victory with a scope and one cartridge left </body></passage>
	<passage><body>see what i mean </body></passage>
	<passage><body>on a sun-fueled, moth eaten afternoon </body></passage>
	<passage><body>it was just outside the ring of firelight </body></passage>
	<passage><body>we came to a sunken wreck of eyes </body></passage>
	<passage><body>at the edge of the curve of memory </body></passage>
	<passage><body>that closed and died waiting forever </body></passage>
	<passage><body>the three cities awoke </body></passage>
	<passage><body>its function is in its role </body></passage>
	<passage><body>it has a different structure </body></passage>
	<passage><body>it's all a question of relationally </body></passage>
	<passage><body>shouting with a mouthful of tobacco </body></passage>
	<passage><body>he tried to rape her armored division </body></passage>
	<passage><body>she wrapped up the polythene commander </body></passage>
	<passage><body>an order to reinforce the bottlenecks </body></passage>
	<passage><body>mostly to buy more time </body></passage>
	<passage><body>the beginning writhing together there was nothing </body></passage>
	<passage><body>bits of an ancient lullaby lost in the wind </body></passage>
	<passage><body>giant magnetic night </body></passage>
	<passage><body>and death, that showman, on every channel </body></passage>
	<passage><body>flow of filth </body></passage>
	<passage><body>as the movie was dreaming of the sky, desperate to be lost in endless depth and silvery clouds </body></passage>
	<passage><body>as the sky was dreaming of the drive-in, desperate to transfix the audience with beauty and a story </body></passage>
	<passage><body>as the city by the bay dreamed of a desert where the light was so sharp everything wore its fangs out </body></passage>
	<passage><body>when everyone awoke the world was almost exactly the same, except that some imperceptible je ne se quois had disappeared forever </body></passage>
	<passage><body>we hitchhiked aboard an ambulance back to the ferry landing </body></passage>
	<passage><body>no one spoke except for the waves </body></passage>
	<passage><body>i walked like funamushi and told the waterfall story </body></passage>
	<passage><body>but no one listened and the wind took the rest </body></passage> 
	<passage><body>my bones were hollow and i wished i could fill them with moonlight </body></passage>
	<passage><body>the winters would take many lives in their depths </body></passage>
	<passage><body>and after many years the townsfolk would tear away their comas like spider webs </body></passage>
	<passage><body>gaining awareness as a sunflower or a rattle-headed man </body></passage>
	<passage><body>perhaps still trapped the cities of dust beneath the cash register </body></passage>
	<passage><body>before long came the cops with white gloves who always make me write my name and check my pockets even when they are empty </body></passage>
	<passage><body>i was the only one left, i realized </body></passage>
	<passage><body>in that drunken world of the red dying sun </body></passage>
	<passage><body>i didn't know what i was saying anymore but something was pushing it out of me and i was trying to keep it in because it was all i had left </body></passage>
	<passage><body>like your favorite story, old and thorny, lurking at the back of your mind </body></passage>
	<passage><body>but is this city just barnacles upon barnacles, dying on top of one another for centuries bleached under the sun, the oily skein of humanity on top? </body></passage>
	<passage><body>speaking but not looking at the face fired upon </body></passage>
	<passage><body>that resembled most people's faces, usually with sharp features, or even tired puffy ones waterlogged with drowned pupils, or the flat droopy ones with flesh the color and consistency of a pancake </body></passage>
	<passage><body>and the eyes clicked back and forth, and the head rotated almost imperceptibly </body></passage>
	<passage><body>these faces never look how you would have them look </body></passage>
	<passage><body>always catching on the crevices between these empty words </body></passage>
	<passage><body>like fissures where light never falls and small talk echoes incomprehensibly in dispassionate bursts </body></passage>
	<passage><body>like blind, scuttling organisms of truth seething with rage that cannibalize each other and coil in heated readiness </body></passage>
	<passage><body>the blink between the words </body></passage>
	<passage><body>ravaged mushroom beds </body></passage>
	<passage><body>a massive milk-colored team </body></passage>
	<passage><body>the trenches were only a few months old </body></passage>
	<passage><body>a salvage artist turned heretic </body></passage>
	<passage><body>like a hookworm or other single-minded parasite </body></passage>
	<passage><body>the haze has seeped in behind the eyes </body></passage>
	<passage><body>the moon has gone sometime stars ground in the teeth all chalky and bitter </body></passage>
	<passage><body>and every night it is given away again and once more we must find it again </body></passage>
	<passage><body>staccato rain songs </body></passage>

<passage><body>and your breath smelled like the floating world i'd nearly forgotten </body></passage>

<passage><body>and your eyes were like looking into a darkened window from outside </body></passage>

<passage><body>enough, i remember saying, enough </body></passage>

<passage><body>i looked at my arms but they looked like branches and i couldn't tell if i was still bleeding </body></passage>

<passage><body>the elevators were drunk and tired of waiting </body></passage>

<passage><body>you said, watch him move: he's got death in him, his voice is a fire alarm and his song is a history of terror </body></passage>

<passage><body>the entrance to the hotel was drunk, contorting itself in awkward shapes and spewing puffs of white steam out its doors at regular intervals, gasps that blew off the doorman's cap </body></passage>

<passage><body>the old woman crawled along the floor like an infant </body></passage>

<passage><body>crowded floors of disgruntled travelers like rats </body></passage>

<passage><body>she often loses her identity, confusing her past with someone else's </body></passage>

<passage><body>like an ancient game that all the old men play, but no one is particularly good at </body></passage>

<passage><body>she remembered the night he fell on the floor, pissed his pants and vomited on the bouncer as he was dragged outside </body></passage>

<passage><body>he looked like a man with his hands on backwards trying to hold onto an avalanche </body></passage>

<passage><body>she said he was the gold medalist of the 30 second fuck </body></passage>

<passage><body>maybe that's a flawed self deception </body></passage>

<passage><body>she was drawn to the old house and in through the open door because of the copious amounts of feral cats </body></passage>

<passage><body>she took all these skills and odd bits of trivia and flung them off a cliff onto the rocks </body></passage>

<passage><body>she had a mystical streak like many women with intense sex lives </body></passage>

<passage><body>he was the only friend she had in that horrible place </body></passage>

<passage><body>he dedicated much of his time to stalking her and trying to avoid the dumb girls he had fucked in his less lucid moments </body></passage>

<passage><body>an ambiguous revenge! </body></passage>

<passage><body>he wrote charismatic, empty stories in that idiotically addictive voice </body></passage>

<passage><body>nearby: an old man has drowned in his mush, soggy and bloated and stinking and rotted, his gin and tonic untouched near the curled blue fingers </body></passage>

<passage><body>a man with his face taped on and cheaply polished trying to sell tiddlywinks to the blind in the alley behind the dry-out center </body></passage>

<passage><body>better skedaddle while your money still out-stares the face of christ </body></passage>

<passage><body>in a distressed condition like a tangle of roots
or a slow dirge sung through clenched teeth </body></passage>

<passage><body>maybe the horizon has become a burning river </body></passage>

<passage><body>because the sky is white and dead like the underside of some great ship </body></passage>

<passage><body>these streets are blinding rivers of energy that swallow those who try to cross--moving too fast to be seen </body></passage>

<passage><body>everything bleached beyond recognition </body></passage>

<passage><body>you were the mud-covered guest </body></passage>

<passage><body>compulsive plucking of hair around the anus and testicles </body></passage>

<passage><body>when discarded on the carpet, takes root </body></passage> 

<passage><body>sprouting a new hairy anal cavity, the balls blossoming in the spring </body></passage>

<passage><body>no one is returning </body></passage>

<passage><body>you been sad a long time </body></passage>

<passage><body>like your whole life is a song that made no sense but it got stuck in your head so you sang it anyway </body></passage>

<passage><body>i felt it too, like walking up irregular stairs in complete blackness </body></passage>

<passage><body>our stomachs are like shrunken black fists </body></passage>

<passage><body>like a box of needles or a box of masks </body></passage>

<passage><body>an insider's guide to me </body></passage>

<passage><body>these marks on the screen little dream stains shriveling before you </body></passage>

<passage><body>and we fucked until you were little more than a tremble in my arms </body></passage>

<passage><body>you walked past the river of drowned stories </body></passage>

<passage><body>you were looking for something you had yet to see </body></passage>

<passage><body>like a silhouette at the edge of your vision </body></passage>

<passage><body>something you needed now more than ever just to breathe </body></passage>

<passage><body>you leapt into the sun, but you still couldn't see it </body></passage>

<passage><body>your pupils were ten thousand light years deep and growing </body></passage>

<passage><body>we sold tickets at the gateless gate </body></passage>

<passage><body>feathers in our hair and skin like cheap rum </body></passage>

<passage><body>you know the audience was wasted </body></passage>

<passage><body>the circus tent was a white coat event horizon </body></passage>

<passage><body>the petals of this wheel </body></passage> 

<passage><body>you felt that time was like a thread you can pull both ways </body></passage>

<passage><body>he fell in love with an allusion </body></passage>

<passage><body>like long standing strands of conversations everyone pulls like puppet strings </body></passage>

<passage><body>god is in the detours </body></passage>

<passage><body>keep your fucking head together </body></passage>
